# My Android notes

Several documents that I maintain for myself. Maybe they can help you too. 

These docs are in Markdown format, prepared to be used with the superb presentation software [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/)

- [Google Maps](google-maps-v2/google-maps-v2.md)
- [ADB: Android Debugging Bridge](adb/adb.md)
- [Check if your Internet connection is alive](check-internet/android-check-internet-connection.md)
- [Play MIDI files in Android](midi-playing/jet-midi-playing.md)
